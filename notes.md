- moved compute_necessary_conditions into a static method in NecessaryConditions
- made "Beluga" class
    - class method run() that takes a problem object, instantiates a Beluga object and calls solve()
    - moved run_optim into the Beluga.solve method
- change inputFile.py into a script
- added continuation steps list (need to rethink representation of steps)
- added bvp solver as input option
- renamed bvpsol.Problem to bvpsol.BVP to avoid any naming clash
